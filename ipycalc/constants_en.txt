#### MEASURED CONSTANTS ####
# Recommended CODATA-2018 values
# To some extent, what is measured and what is derived is a bit arbitrary.
# The choice of measured constants is based on convenience and on available uncertainty.
# The uncertainty in the last significant digits is given in parentheses as a comment.
